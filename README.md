# Keylogger


## Introduction

This project implements a simple keylogger in Python. A keylogger records keystrokes made by a user and can be used for various purposes, such as monitoring computer activity or capturing passwords (for legitimate use or malicious intent).

## Features

* Captures all keyboard input (keystrokes)
* Saves the recorded data to a log file
* Runs in the background without user awareness

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Subhajit-01/PRODIGY_CS_04.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
   pip install pynput
   ```
## Usage

1. Run the keylogger script:
   ```bash
   python key_logger.py
   ```
2. The keylogger will start recording keystrokes and save them to a log file (log.txt by default).

3. To stop the keylogger, press the configured exit key

## Customization
  Modify the log file path and format in the keylogger.py script.
  Customize the exit key or other settings as needed.
